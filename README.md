# The Redirected Walking Toolkit
This is a forked version of the original Redirected Walking Toolkit. We are currently developping and integrating predictive methods (e.g. MPCRed) into the toolkit. 

The associated publication is:

The Redirected Walking Toolkit is currently available for the Unity3D game engine only.
