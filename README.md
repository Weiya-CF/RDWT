# The Redirected Walking Toolkit
This is a forked version of the original Redirected Walking Toolkit.

We are currently developping and integrating newly developed methods, such as predictive methods (e.g. MPCRed) and learning based methods, into the toolkit. 

The Redirected Walking Toolkit is developped with Unity3D, which is an on-going project at School of Software Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.
