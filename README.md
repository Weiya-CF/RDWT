# The Redirected Walking Toolkit
This is a forked version of the original Redirected Walking Toolkit. We are currently developping and integrating predictive methods (e.g. MPCRed) into the toolkit. The Redirected Walking Toolkit is developped with Unity3D.

This is an on-going project at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
